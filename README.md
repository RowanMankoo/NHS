In the recent years, great pressure has been applied on general practices to attend to members of the public.
General practitioners (GPs) are highly skilled doctors who, with the assistance of nurses, are essential in
maintaining health within their local community by providing routine care to patients and treating acute
illnesses. An array of services is provided ranging from vaccinations and examinations to health advice in an
urge to retain a protective stance as the initial point of contact for many patients. Due to their unspecified
nature, GPs only deal with mild and preliminary illnesses with urgent or complex cases being referred to
hospitals. Although GP partners in the UK are funded by the NHS based on the number of patients, they
are known to be ‘independent contractors’ and function like small businesses. Due to the congestive nature
of the practices, patients are required to book appointments beforehand in order to secure meeting with a
doctor.
In this report, the demand on GPs within the regions of Coventry and Rugby was studied by analysing
data sourced from the NHS digital website, the national provider of information in health and social care.
Bearing in mind that the population of the focused region is estimated to be around 500,000, it is clear that
there is an immense obligation of GPs to preserve a consistent service. The online databases were used to
collate, and filter appointment information captured on general practice systems. However, it is important
to acknowledge that this data may not be representative of all activity as not everything is recorded on the
systems, limiting the interpretation of this report. Further details about the data can be found on the NHS
digital website (under “Appointments” in “General Practice”).
